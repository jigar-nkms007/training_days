Man gets two girlfriends, says talaq thrice to wife
AHMEDABAD: A 28-year-old woman from Juhapura on Tuesday filed a complaint with Vejalpur police alleging that her husband has been living with his two girlfriends and has given her instant divorce with the triple-talaq utterance. In her FIR, the woman stated that she had married a man from the Fatehwadi locality, who runs a laundry shop, about ten years ago. After their marriage, her husband began thrashing her over petty issues. In 2016, she had submitted an application to file an FIR of domestic violence but due to the intervention of family members and community leaders, she had to strike a compromise. The woman is a mother of two daughters, aged 9 and 8. She stated in the FIR that over time her husband again began fighting with her over frivolous issues. She alleged that he began coming home late and sometimes did not turn up at all. Whenever she asked where he had been, he used to thrash her. She said that her husband had gone to Delhi about a month ago and when he returned, he was accompanied by two girlfriends for whom he rented a flat in Fatehwadi. When the complainant objected, the accused uttered “talaq” thrice and pushed her out of his home about 20 days ago. Her family members and community leaders tried to persuade the accused to leave his two girlfriends but he paid no heed. She approached Vejalpur police on Tuesday and filed a complaint of domestic violence. Provisions of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act have also been invoked.
