BMC files police complaint against Sonu Sood
The BMC has filed a police complaint against Bollywood star Sonu Sood for allegedly converting the six-storey Shakti Sagar residential building in Juhu into a hotel without the necessary permissions. The actor has, however, denied the allegations.

According to reports, Sood maintains that he had the necessary permissions and was only awaiting clearance from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA).

It was reported that the BMC asked the Juhu police to take cognisance of the offence under the Maharashtra Region and Town Planning (MRTP) Act. In a report on TOI, the BMC's complaint stated, "It has been found that Sonu Sood has instituted/commenced/undertaken/carried out development or changed the user of land. Unauthorised addition/alterations beyond the approved plan and unauthorised change of user from residential to residential hotel building without taking technical sanction from competent authority."

It was alleged that Sonu had not complied with the notice and was continuing to carry out the â€œunauthorised development even after the notice was served on him," said the complaint.

Officials said that Sood had moved the city civil court against a notice sent by the BMC in October last year but did not get any interim relief.

When contacted, Sood said in a statement to TOI, "I have taken approval for change of user from the BMC. It was subject to the approval of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority. This permission hasn't come due to Covid-19. There are no irregularities. I always abide by the law. This hotel was used to house Covid-19 warriors during the pandemic. If permissions don't come, I will restore it back to a residential structure. I am appealing against the BMC's complaint in the Bombay HC."

Abhishek Trimukhe, DCP, Zone 9, said that the police were carrying out preliminary investigation and would later register an FIR.
