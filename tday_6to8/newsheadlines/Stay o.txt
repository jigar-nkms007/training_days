Stay off Sino-Indian border row, China tells US
NEW DELHI: Responding to the outgoing US envoy Kenneth Juster’s remarks on the LAC stand-off, the Chinese ambassador to India Sun Weidong on Wednesday hit out at the US asking it to not meddle in the Sino-Indian border dispute. In his farewell address, Juster had brought up the border stand-off while making the point that no country had contributed to the security of India and Indians as much as the US and also confirming that there had been India-US cooperation on the military situation in Ladakh. “Our close coordination has been important as India confronts, perhaps on a sustained basis, aggressive Chinese activity on its border,” Juster had said. Sun accused the US of targeting China through its relations with India. “We have noticed recent remarks with reference to China by the US side. We oppose any third party meddling in China-India border issue and hope the US relations with others do not target any specific country,” Sun stated in a tweet. This is not the first time that China has asked the US to stay away from the LAC stand-off. Its foreign ministry has continued to maintain that China and India have a full-fledged border related mechanism and communication channel, as also the capability to resolve this issue through dialogue. Juster had refused to elaborate on the nature of military cooperation with India on the LAC issue. “If the government of India wants to comment, that’s for the government of India. Suffice it to say that we have cooperated,” he had said.
