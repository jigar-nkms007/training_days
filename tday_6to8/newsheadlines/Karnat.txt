Karnataka 2nd PU exams 2021 in May
BENGALURU: The examinations for the II PU course will be conducted in May second week and for SSLC in June first week. 

Primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar on Wednesday said the department has identified portions for the exams and these will be delivered to all schools. The department will ensure that the minimum syllabus will be selected so that students will not be overloaded.

In a U-turn, the government said there wonâ€™t be any cut in the syllabus for Class 1 to Class 9, but a different method will be adopted to ease the burden on children. An alternative academic schedule has been finalised. 

According to sources, in the alternative schedule, the department has identified a main competency from each chapter the child needs to progress to the next class. The teacher will be guided to teach that competency instead of the full chapter. Resource teachers will help teachers identify the competency.
