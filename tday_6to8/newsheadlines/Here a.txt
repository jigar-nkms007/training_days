Here are the hybrid pieces you need to invest in NOW!
Winter might be here to stay, but the sun is playing hide and seek. And as much as we loved putting on fuller, heavier clothes to keep us warm, the weather has been treating us with cold evenings and warmer days lately. This puts us in a state of confusion about what to wear that can perfectly suit the warm daytime and cold nighttime without carrying extra things to put on when needed. This makes for the right time to look for pieces that help you transit without needing to change your wardrobe. Here are some hybrid clothing items that you can invest in to update your wardrobe.

-Shackets: This one is a cross between a shirt and a jacket, which is a kind of thick oversized piece of clothing to wear when the weather is unpredictable. Sonam Kapoor Ahuja sported a neutral plaid pick from Bhaane that she layered with a white t-shrit and another black shirt to suit the kind of weather that London has.

- Coatigan: What do you wear when the weather is crisp but not too cold at the same time? Now you have an option for this - a coatigan. It isn't entirely a coat, yet warm enough to keep you cozy. This less-structured coat is the perfect crossbreed piece with knits and soft wools to choose from.

- Jorts: Harry Styles was the one who brought back the jean-shorts hybrid in the Gucci short film recently. Unhemmed, thigh-skimmed style of shorts are going to be the next big thing. If you're into the cut-off look, you can simply chop off a pair of denims to create the jorts look. This one is quite the kind of clothing that you get to wear when the sun is out and the crisp winds aren't too strong to make you feel cold.

- Robigan: Gigi Hadid recently put out a photograph of herself with her little one dressed in a black beanie, turquoise sweatsuit and uggs. This particular look of hers - a taupe coloured knitted robe - was worth noticing. The wrap-around piece is just the right kind of outfit for winter layering that won't particularly weigh you down with structured shoulders or heavy-duty fabrics.
